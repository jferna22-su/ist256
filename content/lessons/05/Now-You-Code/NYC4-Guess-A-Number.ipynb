    "    - My main issues were getting my indents correct. I fixed this by just going checking the errors and making chnages based off what the error told me. \n",
    "    - The second was getting it to ask for an input again after the first guess. I overcame this by removing the break statements after the if statemnts regarding the guess being too low or high.\n",
    "    - The other issue I had was that I got type errors because I didn't assign the variables as integers. I fixed this by assigning both guesses and user_number as integers.\n"
