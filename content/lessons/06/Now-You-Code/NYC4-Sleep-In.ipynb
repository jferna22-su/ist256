    "\n",
    "1. Provide 3 advantages for programming a user function in your code like `IsWeekend`?\n",
    "     - They help make a minimize the amount of code needed for programs which helps with keeping your code clean and more able to read.\n",
    "    - If you have a lot of repetitive code in a program making a function to execute those codes will help clean it up.\n",
    "    - On large projects you can use functions to seperate up the work which will make it easier to debug.\n",
    "2. Why did we need to write 7 tests?\n",
    "    - Because we need to test each day of the week.\n",
    "3. Which code is easier to understand? Step 1 or step 4? Why? or Why not?\n",
    "    - I think they are very close, but I think step four is a bit easier to read because the flow is better. I think it is easier to read and understand what is happening.\n",
    "4. What happens when you input `'sat'` for `'Saturday'` Does it work? How can the program be improved? Does improving it affect the readability of step 4? (HINT: Abstractions!!!)\n",
    "    - The code runs, but the result isn't right. The program can be improved using lists and calling them as well as abstractions.  It would affect the readability a little bit with the lists because there would be more words/code.\n"
