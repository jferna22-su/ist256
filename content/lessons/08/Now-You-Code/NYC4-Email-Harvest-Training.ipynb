    "2. Explain how this program can be improved to prompt for an email file at runtime?\n",
    " - you can set a variable that asks for a file name to open and search for emails within. That way you can let the user input any file they have that they want to extract email addresses from.\n",
    "3. Devise an approach to remove duplicate emails from the output file. You don't have to write as code, just explain it.\n",
    " - I would add in code that only appends with new emails. This would scan the save file and only add emails if it is not found in the file."
