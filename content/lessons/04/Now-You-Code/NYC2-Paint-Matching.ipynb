    "- Everyday quality paint is `$19.99` per gallon.\n",
    "- Select quality paint is `$24.99` per gallon.\n",
    "- Premium quality paint is `$32.99` per gallon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition if the customer wants computerized color-matching that incurs an additional fee of `$4.99` per gallon. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to ask the user to select a paint quality: 'everyday', 'select' or 'premium', prompt for color matching, and then outputs the price per gallon of the paint.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. When you enter something other than `'everyday', 'select',` or  `'premium'` what happens? Modify the program to print `that is not a paint quality` and then exit in those cases.\n",
    "    - The program will run, but you will not get a correct output.\n",
    "2. What happens when you enter something other than `'y'` or `'n'` for color matching? Re-write the program to print `you must enter y or n` whenever you enter something other than those two values.\n",
    "    - The program runs, but you will n ot get a correct output.\n",
    "3. Why can't we use Python's `try...except` in this example?\n",
    "    - We can't use the try...except function in this example because we are using the \"in\" statement for error checking in this code.\n",
    "4. How many times (at minimum) must we execute this program and check the results before we can be reasonably assured it is correct?\n",
    "    - Eight times because you need to check each type with and without color matching as well as using incorrect inputs for both paint choice and color matching choice."
