Why?\n- The code does still run, but your names are in reverse. The reason it still runs is because you are giving correct input types. \n2. What type of error is it when the program runs but does not handle bad input?\n- run time error\n3. Is there anything you can do in code to correct this type of error? Why or why not?\n- I am not aware of any code to correct this type of error.\n"
