Why?\n- The code still runs, but it gives you a jumbled output that isn't how it was intended to be. The code still runs because the iputs are proper values.\n2. What type of error occurs when the program runs but does not handle bad input?\n- Value error\n3. Is there anything you can do in code to correct this type of error? Why or why not?\n- I do not know if any code to correct this."
