We're going to keep it really simple, and ask for 4 inputs:\n- a woman's name  \n- a place\n- an item\n- a material \n\nThe place and material must rhyme. The Python program will then output the first two lines of the limerick, substituting the values you've entered. \n\n**Example 1:**\n\nINPUT:\n\n- Enter a woman's name: Jane\n- Enter a place: New York\n- Enter an item: hat\n- Enter a material, which rhymes with 'New York': cork.\n\nOUTPUT:\nI once knew Jane from New York. Her hat was constructed of cork.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nINPUT:\n\n- Enter a woman's name: Agatha\n- Enter a place: my car\n- Enter an item: bike\n- Enter a material, which rhymes with 'my car': tar\n\nOUTPUT: \nI once knew Agatha from my car. Her bike was constructed of tar.\n"
