    "\n",
    "1. When we write functions we usually don't have `input()` or `print()` Python functions in them, but in this solution we do. What is the advantage of doing it in this example?\n",
    "    - The advantage is that we make sure the user made the correct choice to add or remove the list. This also helps us create different variables for each of these.\n",
    "2. Explain a strategy you can employ to save the list to a file and load it back. How would that work?\n",
    "    - I would create a variable that would open the file to save as soon as the program starts. I would then append it with each input and delete from it every removal. For the print function I would have it print the file.\n",
    "3. What does the `.upper()` method function accomplish in the main program?\n",
    "    - It makes the entry upper case so if the user enters a lower case letter it will make it uppercase so it is valid."
