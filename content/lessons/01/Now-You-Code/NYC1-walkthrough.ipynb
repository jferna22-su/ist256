What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60?\n You get a NameError when you enter two and a SyntaxError when you enter $60.  \n2. Why do you think this happens?\nI believe this is because we are telling it to only look for numbers and not any letters or symbols.\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining?\nWhen you enter 0.5 for the number of people dining you get a ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero. So basically it doesn't allow you to divide by zero because you really can't divide anything by zero. It is set to only divide by a whole number.\n"
